# Paint_the_Wall


The Paint Can Calculator is a simple yet practical Python program 
designed to assist in estimating the number of paint cans required to paint a wall of any given area. 
This program takes user inputs for the dimensions of the wall and the coverage area per can of paint. 
It then calculates and provides an approximate count of paint cans needed to cover the entire wall.
